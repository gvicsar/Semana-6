			<h2>Our Bakery</h2>
			<p>Our Bakery offers scrumptious Italian-inspired evening meals, but also supplies our shop with freshly baked bread to be enjoyed with delicious cheeses from our Cheese Room. We grow our own wheat on the farm which is stoneground after harvest. This flour is sold in the Farm Shop, but is also used by our own bakers who, under the guidance of our head baker Ernie Beck, make sure we have freshly baked bread early every morning for our restaurants and the Tasting Room. We have a variety of breads, including sourdough, rye, white and whole wheat.<br>At dinners in the Bakery, we serve our food family style guests dish up for themselves from wooden boards placed on their table. Our Italian inspired set menu starts with an antipasti and salad offering. Main course may be enjoyed to your hearts content. We round off the meal with a delicious dolce and our famous coffee.</p>
